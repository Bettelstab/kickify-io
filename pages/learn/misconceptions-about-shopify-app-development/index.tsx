          <strong>It&apos;s Too Difficult:</strong> Many people think that developing
          an app for Shopify is overly complicated and time-consuming. However,
          the Shopify App Store makes it easy to create an app for Shopify and
          the platform provides helpful resources to guide the development
          process.

          <strong>You Need To Be A Coder:</strong> While coding is required to
          develop a Shopify app, it is not necessary to be a professional coder
          to create a basic app. With the help of tutorials and documentation,
          anyone can develop an app for Shopify.

        <li>
          <strong>It&apos;s Too Expensive:</strong> Developing an app for Shopify can
          be done on a budget. There are many free resources available to help
          developers build their apps, as well as many free app templates that
          can be used to quickly create an app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>It Requires Constant Maintenance:</strong> Maintaining an app
          for Shopify does not require too much work. The platform makes it easy
          to keep the app up-to-date, and the app store also provides helpful
          resources to help with any maintenance needs.

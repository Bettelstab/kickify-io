      <ul>
        <li>
          Selling Products: You can make money with Shopify by selling products
          directly to customers from your online store. You can create your own
          product line and list it on your store or look for dropshipping
          suppliers who will ship products to your customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offering Services: You can also offer services such as web design,
          digital marketing, or copywriting on your Shopify store.
        </li>
        <li>
          Affiliate Marketing: You can earn money by promoting other people’s
          products and services on your store. You’ll receive a commission when
          customers purchase the products or services you’re promoting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Selling on Social Media: You can leverage Shopify’s integration with
          social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to promote and
          sell products directly to customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Selling Advertising Space: You can also offer advertising space on
          your store to businesses that are related to your product niche. This
          is a great way to monetize your store without having to sell products.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sell your own app: You can create and sell your own app directly on
          the Shopify App Store. You can charge a one-time fee or a recurring
          subscription to access your app.{" "}

          Let‚Äôs say you want to react to each and every new order. You can use
          Shopify‚Äôs webhooks to receive events. However, these are error-prone
          and it is advisable to do regular pulling so you won‚Äôt miss any order.
          So you need to maintain a local copy of all the orders you have seen.
          Or you use our handy service to do that for you and provide you with
          fail-safe events. <br />
          <br />
          We can do this for any type of data available with Shopify webhooks,
          of course! <br />
